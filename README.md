**Knotch** is a fork of [Boring.Notch](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch) that transforms the MacBook notch into a live, interactive hub — music controls, album art, system HUD replacements, lock screen widgets, a drag-and-drop shelf, calendar, and more.

## Features

- Sneak peek on playback changes (collapsed notch preview)
- Lock screen music widget with frosted glass or tinted style
- Expanded album art background on lock screen *(Beta)*
- Lyrics display below artist name *(Beta)*
- Configurable media inactivity timeout and full-screen behavior

**System HUD Replacement**
- Replaces macOS volume, display brightness, and keyboard brightness HUDs
- Inline or overlay HUD style with optional gradient and glow
- Accent color tinting and shadow effects

**Notch Widgets**
- Calendar integration with reminders, all-day event filtering, and auto-scroll
- Mirror widget (webcam preview in the notch)
- Battery indicator with charging status, percentage, and power notifications
- Download progress indicator for Safari and other browsers

**Shelf**
- Drag files into the notch to stage them for AirDrop or LocalSend
- Configurable drag detection area, copy-on-drag, and auto-remove after sharing

**Lock Screen**
- Screen lock icon and notch lock protection
- Music widget displayed over the lock screen with selectable glass style
- Expanded album art background

**Customization**
- Notch size modes: match real notch, match menu bar, or fully custom
- Corner radius scaling, window shadow, accent color
- Emoji display, settings icon in notch, face animation when idle
- Keyboard shortcuts for sneak peek and open/close toggle
- Works on both notch and non-notch displays; multi-display aware

## System Requirements

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Manually

<a href="https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch/releases/latest/download/Knotch.dmg"><img width="200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3179be1-8416-4b8a-b417-743e1ecc67d6" alt="Download for macOS" /></a>

Open the `.dmg` and move **Knotch** to your `/Applications` folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Knotch is not yet notarized. macOS will block it on first launch. Run this once to clear the quarantine flag, then open normally:
> ```bash
> xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Knotch.app
> ```
> Alternatively: open the app, dismiss the warning, then go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**. (This method doesn't work for all users.)

### Option 2: Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask TheBoredTeam/boring-notch/boring-notch
```
Homebrew handles the quarantine bypass automatically.
