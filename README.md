**Knotch** is a fork of [Boring.Notch](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch) that transforms the MacBook notch into a live, interactive hub — music controls, album art, system HUD replacements, lock screen widgets, a drag-and-drop shelf, calendar, and more.

- Configurable media inactivity timeout and full-screen behavior

- Inline or overlay HUD style with optional gradient and glow
- Accent color tinting and shadow effects

**Notch Widgets**

- Mirror widget (webcam preview in the notch)
- Battery indicator with charging status, percentage, and power notifications
- Download progress indicator for Safari and other browsers

**Shelf**
- Drag files into the notch to stage them for AirDrop or LocalSend
- Configurable drag detection area, copy-on-drag, and auto-remove after sharing

**Lock Screen**
- Screen lock icon and notch lock protection
- Music widget displayed over the lock screen with selectable glass style
- Expanded album art background

**Customization**
- Notch size modes: match real notch, match menu bar, or fully custom
